### [Politeness Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politeness_theory#Politeness_strategies)
Concept of Face in Politeness:

The wish of every member of a community to guard his or her face from possible damage through social interferences 

- Positive face: the wish or desire to gain approval of others.
- Negative face: the wish to be unimpeded by others in oneâ€™s actions.

Politeness Strategies:

- Positive Politeness -  minimize the threat to the hearer's positive face (where audience knows each other fairly well)
    - You look sad. Can I do anything?
    - Offer or promise (If you wash the dishes, I'll vacuum the floor.)
- Negative Politeness - minimize threar to hearer's negative face
    - Apologetic
    - Pessimistic
- Bald-on record - direct speech like giving advice, used when close relationship between speaker and hearer
    - Your headlights are on!
    - Leave it, I'll clean up later.

- Off-record (indirect) - speaker tries to speak in a way to not impose on the hearer or gives a better chance for the hearer to be helpful and generous

Examples: 
(Im): Grab the chair for the speaker
(Po): Do you have a free chair over there?

(Im) Can you lend me a thousand dollars?
(Po) I'm sorry; it's a lot to ask, but can you lend me a thousand dollars?
